Hi! I'm Neemesh. \
I graduated from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) with a B.Tech degree in 2024, where I also worked as a UG Researcher at the [LCS2](https://lcs2.in/) lab. I was a Research Intern at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working with Prof. Preslav Nakov for their very first Undergraduate Research Intern Program (UGRIP) in the Summer of 2023. My recent collaborations include work in uncertainty estimation + debiasing[^2].\
<!--I am also collaborating with Prof. Ee-Peng Lim on answering social science questions with multi-agent LLM settings, and Dr. Zhijing Jin on exploring the optimality of sustainable cooperation between LLM agents in a more complex setting.-->

My research interests broadly lie between Computational Social Science and Interpretability. More specifically, I am interested in exploring how or if LLMs are capable of reasoning and the dynamics of societal biases within them -- from a causal lens; improving their social intelligence and trying to understand how they behave the way they do. I am devoted to building transparent, explainable, fair, and truthful AI.

In addition to this, my favorite pastime involves playing video games and watching anime or random YouTube videos.

_I am currently looking for research opportunities (both PhD and collaborations)!_
