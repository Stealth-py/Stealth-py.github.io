Hi! I'm Neemesh.\
I am currently working as a Research Engineer at SMU under Prof. Lim Ee-Peng's group. My work at SMU primarily focuses on improving the Theory-of-Mind reasoning of LLM agents in contexts of counseling and game environments. I am also remotely collaborating with Prof. Zhijing Jin where we focus on content moderation and censorship in LLMs.

I graduated from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) with a B.Tech degree in 2024, where I also worked as a UG Researcher at the [LCS2](https://lcs2.in/) lab. I was a Research Intern at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working with Prof. Preslav Nakov for their very first Undergraduate Research Intern Program (UGRIP) in the Summer of 2023. My collaboration with researchers at MBZUAI through [LibrAI](https://www.librai.tech/) for work in debiasing + uncertainty estimation[^2] was accepted to NAACL'25!

In addition to this, my favorite pastime involves playing League of Legends or soulslike games (think Elden Ring and Dark Souls) and watching anime or random YouTube videos.

_I am currently looking for research opportunities (both PhD and industry level) for 2026!_
